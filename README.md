This is a lightweight REST API that stores “games” in a local repository, allowing CRUD functions to be performed against it. A “game” object consists of “Id”, “Title”, “Genre”, “Developer”, and “ReleaseYear” attributes. Users can perform GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE requests to interact with the games repository. The API is secured using an API key that is also stored locally. This was developed using Azure Functions in C#, with Visual Studio Code and tested with the ThunderClient extension.
